## ⚠️ Risks & Warnings

### **Potential Risks:**

❌ **Battery Drain**
- High performance mode = faster battery consumption
- Estimated: 20-40% faster drain during gaming

❌ **Thermal Issues**
- Increased CPU/GPU usage = more heat
- May trigger thermal throttling on some devices
- Recommended: Use in cool environment

❌ **System Instability**
- Some devices may experience lag or stuttering
- Rare cases: System UI crashes (just reboot)

❌ **Compatibility**
- Not all Android versions support all optimizations
- Some properties may not work on custom ROMs

❌ **No Root = Limited Access**
- Cannot modify system files
- Cannot adjust CPU governor
- Cannot change kernel parameters

### **Safety Features Built-in:**

✅ **Thermal Monitoring** - Auto-reduces boost if overheating  
✅ **Cleanup on Exit** - Restores normal settings when stopped  
✅ **Non-Root Safe** - Only uses debug properties  
✅ **Reversible** - All changes are temporary

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Script Won't Run:**
```bash
# Check file exists
adb shell ls -la /sdcard/RPG-46.sh

# Check permissions
adb shell chmod +x /sdcard/RPG-46.sh

# Try running directly
adb shell sh /sdcard/RPG-46.sh
```

### **No Performance Improvement:**
- Your device may not support debug properties
- Try rebooting after first run
- Check if USB debugging is still enabled
- Some ROMs block these optimizations

### **Device Gets Too Hot:**
- Stop the script immediately (Ctrl+C)
- The thermal monitor will auto-reduce boost
- Use a phone cooler or fan
- Reduce gaming session duration

### **Battery Drains Too Fast:**
- This is normal with performance mode
- Reduce `GPU_BOOST_LEVEL` from 85 to 70
- Increase `CHECK_INTERVAL` from 10 to 20 seconds
- Use only when needed for intense gaming

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **🔋 Battery Saver:** Run script only during gaming sessions
2. **❄️ Cooling:** Use external cooling fan for best results
3. **⚡ Power:** Keep phone plugged in during long sessions
4. **🎮 Games:** Works best with 3D games (PUBG, Genshin, etc.)
5. **📱 Clean:** Close background apps before gaming
6. **🔄 Reboot:** Restart device if experiencing issues
